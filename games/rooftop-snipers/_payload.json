Jump and shoot to avoid getting hit while trying to land a shot on your enemy.\n\nThe game features simple one-button controls and ragdoll physics, leading to hilarious and unpredictable battles.

Bridges wobble, platforms tilt, and small jumps punish heavy landings. You feather the throttle, tap the brake to settle, and accept that patience solves more problems than speed.\n\nMoment to moment you’re managing weight: lean in before a ramp, lift to avoid a nose‑down crash, and correct mid‑air without oversteering. Levels escalate cleanly, and the best clears feel like tidy puzzles solved by good pacing. It’s playful, readable, and built for quick wins that stack up.","/media/drive-mad.webp",[20,10,21],"driving","new","https://drive-madgame.github.io/file/",{"slug":24,"title":25,"description":26,"image":27,"categories":28,"format":11,"url":30},"geometry-dash","Geometry Dash","Geometry Dash is a rhythm-based platformer that will test your patience and skills.

You interact with the scene directly—drag items, combine them, move text, or reveal things hidden off screen—to find the trick that solves the level. The draw is the steady stream of small “aha” moments and the way even simple prompts hide playful solutions. If you’re stuck, read the question carefully, try manipulating the background, and consider whether the answer comes from an object you create rather than one already shown. It’s light, fast, and designed for quick sessions that feel satisfying when a stubborn level finally gives way.","/media/brain-test-tricky-puzzles.webp",[37,10,21],"puzzle","https://23azostore.github.io/s2/brain-test-tricky-puzzles/",{"slug":40,"title":41,"description":42,"image":43,"categories":44,"format":11,"url":46},"8-ball-pool","8 Ball Pool","8 Ball Pool turns a familiar barroom duel into a sleek ladder of quick matches and steady progression. Breaks matter—set the rack moving cleanly and you’ll find patterns faster. From there it’s a lesson in touch: soft shots that nurse position, draw that opens angles on the next ball, and the quiet confidence to take a long cut when the table calls for it. Physics are crisp, so a good stroke feels honest, and mistakes teach immediately.\n\nAs your aim improves, the rooms change, stakes rise, and tournaments test whether you can string frames under pressure. Coins unlock cues and venues, but the heart stays in the geometry—finding routes that keep you in control and refusing the hero shot when the safety is wiser. Matches are short enough to fit a break and deep enough to be satisfying, and momentum can flip on a single great pot. It’s pool for the modern moment—accessible in seconds, endlessly replayable, and always nudging you toward cleaner lines.","/media/8-ball-pool.webp",[45,10],"sports","https://sudoku-online.github.io/a8/8-ball-pool/",{"slug":48,"title":49,"description":50,"image":51,"categories":52,"format":11,"url":54},"among-us","Among Us","Among Us is a social deduction game where a team of crewmates tries to complete simple tasks while one or more impostors work to stop them. Each round plays out in short bursts of movement and discussion: fix a sabotage, finish a task, or report a body and talk through what you’ve seen. Crewmates win by finishing all tasks or voting out the impostors; impostors win by causing enough chaos and eliminating the crew without being caught.\n\nIt’s easy to understand after a few matches and scales well with different group sizes. Maps change the layout of tasks and travel routes, and small settings tweaks can make games faster or more methodical. The appeal is in the stories that form—alibis that don’t add up, quiet players who turn out to be sharp observers, and those tense moments around the emergency button when suspicion swings from one person to another.","/media/among-us.webp",[53,10],"strategy","https://amongusplay.online/",{"slug":56,"title":57,"description":58,"image":59,"categories":60,"format":11,"url":61},"basketball-stars","Basketball Stars","Basketball Stars is a fast one‑minute basketball match with simple controls and clear momentum swings. You pick a character, choose a mode, and trade drives, blocks, steals, and jump shots in tight possessions that reward timing more than complex inputs. Modes cover quick games, bracket tournaments, and local two‑player play in 1v1 or 2v2, so it works well for a short break or a longer run. Most of the depth comes from small reads—hold position for a block instead of chasing, dash into space for a clean dunk, or save a special move for the last possession. It’s easy to pick up, lively when played with a friend, and competitive enough to keep rematches coming.","/media/basketball-stars.webp",[45,10],"https://basketballstarsonline.github.io/file/",{"slug":63,"title":64,"description":65,"image":66,"categories":67,"format":11,"url":68},"cannon-strike","Cannon Strike","Cannon Strike is a physics puzzle about firing pellets into a container while the path changes around you. You set angle and timing from a fixed cannon, then watch pellets bounce off surfaces, slip through rotating bars, and settle—if you judged correctly—where you need them. Early levels are forgiving, but later layouts ask for tighter shots and a better sense of how motion will carry after a bounce.\n\nMoment to moment you’re deciding whether to shoot now or wait for a safer alignment. The game respects patience; a clean release is usually better than brute force. Limited ammo or stricter thresholds show up as you progress, which encourages smarter planning rather than rushing. It’s the kind of puzzle where each success feels earned, and small adjustments lead to reliable solutions without trial‑and‑error grind.","/media/cannon-strike.webp",[9],"https://gamaverse.com/c/f/g/cannon-strike/",{"slug":70,"title":71,"description":72,"image":73,"categories":74,"format":11,"url":75},"cookie-clicker","Cookie Clicker","Cookie Clicker is an incremental game about turning simple clicks into ever‑larger numbers. You start by making cookies manually, then buy upgrades and buildings that produce them automatically. Over time the rate climbs, new options unlock, and strategic choices—what to buy next, when to save, how to balance short‑term gains with long‑term multipliers—shape your progress.\n\nThe moment to moment play alternates between active bursts and quieter planning. It’s easy to slip into a rhythm of setting goals, reaching them, and choosing the next target. The humor is dry and the systems transparent, which helps the numbers feel satisfying rather than abstract. If you enjoy watching a plan compound into bigger results, this serves that loop well without demanding constant attention.","/media/cookie-clicker.webp",[29,10],"https://23azostore.github.io/s/cookie-clicker/",{"slug":77,"title":78,"description":79,"image":80,"categories":81,"format":11,"url":82},"drift-hunters","Drift Hunters","Drift Hunters is a 3D driving game centered on controlled slides rather than racing lines. Long corners invite you to set a drift early, balance throttle and counter‑steer, and hold angle without spinning. Points accrue when you keep slides stable and string them together, so the best runs look smooth rather than wild.\n\nMoment to moment you’re reading grip and correcting gently—add gas to sustain, ease off when angle grows, and straighten cleanly before a new section. Progression gives you room to try quicker setups and refine handling, and practice turns consistent laps into flowing sessions. It’s a satisfying space to chase better control.","/media/drift-hunters.webp",[20,10],"https://www.gamenora.com/upload/games/html5/Drift%20Hunters/",{"slug":84,"title":85,"description":86,"image":87,"categories":88,"format":11,"url":89},"football-legends","Football Legends","Football Legends lets you play as famous soccer stars in intense 1-on-1 or 2-on-2 matches.
