You jump, slide, and adjust in midair to thread gaps, bounce off platforms, and avoid hazards that punish sloppy timing. Levels are short and restart instantly, which puts the focus on learning patterns and carrying clean movement from one challenge to the next.\n\nMoment to moment you’re committing early—jump now to catch the apex—or waiting a beat to let a threat pass. Progress comes from rhythm more than speed, and the satisfaction lives in a perfect section that used to look impossible. It’s approachable, quick, and tuned for those small got it moments.","/media/dreadhead-parkour.webp",[9],"action","html5","https://g.igroutka.ru/games/164/jtXUliV8F1r04dve/4/dreadhead_parkour/",[13,20,27,34,41,48,55,62,69],{"slug":14,"title":15,"description":16,"image":17,"categories":18,"format":10,"url":19},"burrito-bison","Burrito Bison","Burrito Bison is a launch‑and‑bounce game where distance comes from smart timing and messy collisions. Each run begins with a powerful throw, then you keep speed by slamming into gummy opponents and chaining hits without dropping momentum. Obstacles, gates, and brief slowdowns force you to read the road and decide when to use a heavy slam or save a boost for a cleaner section ahead.\n\nThe loop is short and satisfying: push a little farther, earn currency, and invest in upgrades that make the next attempt more stable. Moment to moment you’re watching arcs, nudging the angle to catch a high‑value target, and choosing whether to burn a special ability to rescue a sagging run. The challenge is consistency rather than perfection, and small improvements add up until long, flowing chains become normal.\n\nIt’s bright and playful, but it rewards attention. Runs feel better when you manage pacing—holding off on a slam to keep a combo alive, or spending at the right time to break through a barrier. Progression isn’t only about raw power; it’s learning to spot good lines and avoiding stalls that kill speed. That mix keeps retries engaging, turning a minute into a series of fun, measurable gains.","/media/burrito-bison.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s7/burrito-bison/",{"slug":21,"title":22,"description":23,"image":24,"categories":25,"format":10,"url":26},"house-of-hazards","House of Hazards","House of Hazards is a hilarious multiplayer game where completing simple household chores becomes a chaotic challenge.
