You interact with the scene directly—drag items, combine them, move text, or reveal things hidden off screen—to find the trick that solves the level. The draw is the steady stream of small “aha” moments and the way even simple prompts hide playful solutions. If you’re stuck, read the question carefully, try manipulating the background, and consider whether the answer comes from an object you create rather than one already shown. It’s light, fast, and designed for quick sessions that feel satisfying when a stubborn level finally gives way.","/media/brain-test-tricky-puzzles.webp",[9,20,21],"popular","new","https://23azostore.github.io/s2/brain-test-tricky-puzzles/",{"slug":24,"title":25,"description":26,"image":27,"categories":28,"format":11,"url":29},"among-us","Among Us","Among Us is a social deduction game where a team of crewmates tries to complete simple tasks while one or more impostors work to stop them. Each round plays out in short bursts of movement and discussion: fix a sabotage, finish a task, or report a body and talk through what you’ve seen. Crewmates win by finishing all tasks or voting out the impostors; impostors win by causing enough chaos and eliminating the crew without being caught.\n\nIt’s easy to understand after a few matches and scales well with different group sizes. Maps change the layout of tasks and travel routes, and small settings tweaks can make games faster or more methodical. The appeal is in the stories that form—alibis that don’t add up, quiet players who turn out to be sharp observers, and those tense moments around the emergency button when suspicion swings from one person to another.","/media/among-us.webp",[10,20],"https://amongusplay.online/",{"slug":31,"title":32,"description":33,"image":34,"categories":35,"format":11,"url":36},"arithmetica","Arithmetica","Arithmetica is a one‑minute sprint of mental math. Equations appear quickly and you tap the correct answer; each fast, correct response adds a sliver of time, and misses waste precious seconds. It’s simple to start and ramps up as your pace increases.\n\nPlayed daily, it’s a tidy way to sharpen arithmetic in short sessions. The loop is honest—speed comes from accuracy—and the timer makes even basic problems feel engaging when you’re chasing a personal best.","/media/arithmetica.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/arithmetica/",{"slug":38,"title":39,"description":40,"image":41,"categories":42,"format":11,"url":44},"blumgi-castle","Blumgi Castle","Blumgi Castle is a slingshot skill game about dropping enemies into the water with well‑placed shots and tools. You aim with an indicator, hold to set power, and release to fire bombs or special weapons that can carve platforms, push creatures off edges, or clear cover. There’s room to experiment—bigger blasts, saws, lasers, and other toys reward different approaches—and finishing a level cleanly often comes down to picking one good angle and sticking to it.

You place chickens on slots to shoot approaching targets, then drag identical units together to create stronger ones. Waves escalate gradually, and coins earned during play fund more slots and upgrades, which keep the board feeling busy without demanding constant micromanagement.\n\nThe moment‑to‑moment decisions are simple—merge now for immediate damage or hold pieces to combine later into a bigger tier; reposition a strong unit to cover a weak lane; invest in economy or in firepower. Progress comes in steady steps, and small optimizations turn into noticeable gains. It’s a pleasant loop that works for brief sessions and longer stretches, with clear feedback and enough variety to stay engaging.","/media/chicken-merge.webp",[10],"https://23azostore.github.io/s4/chicken-merge/",{"slug":53,"title":54,"description":55,"image":56,"categories":57,"format":11,"url":58},"hextris","Hextris","Hextris is a fast‑paced puzzle game inspired by Tetris but played on a hexagon.
