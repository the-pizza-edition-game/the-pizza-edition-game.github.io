Traffic and rivers form shifting patterns: cars pace in lanes, logs glide at different speeds, and trains cut through on a strict schedule. You dart across when a window opens, pause when it closes, and learn to avoid risky moves that lead to stranded hops.\n\nMoment to moment you’re scanning a few steps ahead and trusting small timings—a quick double hop, a hold to let a lane clear, a step back to avoid a bad sequence. The pace is gentle at first and grows as you survive longer, and the satisfaction comes from making clean, sensible choices. It’s easy to start and tough to master, with runs that tell short stories of near misses and tidy escapes.","/media/crossy-road.webp",[9,10],"arcade","originals","html5","https://ubg98.github.io/CrossyRoad/",[14,23,30,37,44,51,58,66,74,81,88,95],{"slug":15,"title":16,"description":17,"image":18,"categories":19,"format":11,"url":22},"geometry-dash","Geometry Dash","Geometry Dash is a rhythm-based platformer that will test your patience and skills.

One moment you’re angling a toe‑poke past a frantic goalkeeper, the next you’re timing a leap in an archery duel or baiting a rival tank onto a cliff. The physics are playful but consistent, so the difference between chaos and control is learning the rhythm and trusting your timing.\n\nWhat makes it sticky is the speed. Rounds last seconds, momentum swings fast, and that single well‑timed press can feel like a masterstroke when the crowd erupts. You don’t need to memorize systems or grind unlocks; the fun comes from reading each scenario and improvising under pressure. It’s the kind of game that turns a quiet evening into a tournament where \"best of five\" becomes \"best of twenty\" without anyone noticing—easy to start, hard to stop, and perfectly tuned for laughter, grudge matches, and tiny comebacks that feel huge.","/media/12-minibattles.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/12-minibattles/",{"slug":31,"title":32,"description":33,"image":34,"categories":35,"format":11,"url":36},"a-dance-of-fire-and-ice","A Dance of Fire and Ice","A Dance of Fire and Ice is rhythm distilled: one button, perfect timing, and paths that turn music into motion. Two luminous orbs trace angles, gaps, and sudden switches, and your only job is to press exactly on the beat. There’s no generous buffer or off‑beat mercy—calibrate once, breathe, and trust the soundtrack as patterns grow from simple steps to layered syncopation.\n\nEach world introduces an idea and then tests your understanding with playful twists. A time signature change resets your count, a deceptive curve hides a double tap, a quiet bridge asks for focus more than speed. It’s challenging but fair, and when the press lands and the path flows without a stutter, there’s a singular satisfaction in the way sound and motion snap into one. For rhythm‑game devotees, it’s pure signal: clear rules, precise feedback, and the enduring thrill of mastery.","/media/a-dance-of-fire-and-ice.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s8/a-dance-of-fire-and-ice/",{"slug":38,"title":39,"description":40,"image":41,"categories":42,"format":11,"url":43},"aqua-thrills","Aqua Thrills","Aqua Thrills is a fast water‑slide racer about simple steering and good timing. You guide a tube down long, winding slides, adjust left and right to hold a line, and bump rivals when you need space. Races are short and forgiving at first, then add tighter curves, faster sections, and hazards that ask for cleaner inputs.\n\nProgress brings new parks, slides, and cosmetic unlocks. The controls stay straightforward, which makes it easy to jump in for a few runs and see improvement quickly. If you enjoy lightweight racing with clear feedback and quick restarts, it scratches that itch well without getting complicated.","/media/aqua-thrills.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/aqua-thrills/",{"slug":45,"title":46,"description":47,"image":48,"categories":49,"format":11,"url":50},"battle-wheels","Battle Wheels","Battle Wheels is a quick 1v1 arena bout where open‑top cars try to bonk each other on the head. You lurch forward and back to build rhythm, flip for height, and aim to land a clean hit that drains health. Between rounds, simple upgrades to health, damage, and wheels help your car feel sturdier or sharper, and a local two‑player mode turns it into a light, competitive party game. The physics do most of the work—small nudges set up flips, and flips set up roof drops—so the match becomes about timing rather than perfect driving lines. It’s fast, readable, and good for a few rounds at a time.","/media/battle-wheels.webp",[9],"https://i.gamesgo.net/uploads/game/html5/25939/",{"slug":52,"title":53,"description":54,"image":55,"categories":56,"format":11,"url":57},"big-shot-boxing","Big Shot Boxing","Big Shot Boxing is a pared‑down boxing career that hinges on patient timing. Fights use a small set of inputs—jabs, crosses, uppercuts, and blocks—and the rhythm is about stamina, guard openings, and taking the simple shot when it’s there. Outside the ring you pick a trainer, build basic stats, and climb from early cards toward title bouts, with the sense that any match can swing if you lose focus. The pixel look fits the straightforward design, and the loop of train‑fight‑recover makes short sessions feel productive. If you like boxing without complex systems, this offers honest rounds where a few good reads decide the night.","/media/big-shot-boxing.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/big-shot-boxing/",{"slug":59,"title":60,"description":61,"image":62,"categories":63,"format":11,"url":65},"blumgi-ball","Blumgi Ball","Blumgi Ball blends basketball shots with simple puzzle layouts. You pull back to set power and angle, release to send the ball, and press to teleport next to it so you can chain throws from smarter positions. Levels introduce surfaces, gaps, and tricks that ask for one or two clean shots rather than brute force. As you clear stages, you unlock new characters and learn small habits—teleport before the bounce you want, aim lower when an obstacle steals arc, and keep attempts tight to avoid awkward ricochets. It’s compact, responsive, and satisfying when a planned sequence lands.","/media/blumgi-ball.webp",[64,10],"sports","https://sudoku-online.github.io/a2/blumgi-ball/",{"slug":67,"title":68,"description":69,"image":70,"categories":71,"format":11,"url":73},"blumgi-castle","Blumgi Castle","Blumgi Castle is a slingshot skill game about dropping enemies into the water with well‑placed shots and tools. You aim with an indicator, hold to set power, and release to fire bombs or special weapons that can carve platforms, push creatures off edges, or clear cover. There’s room to experiment—bigger blasts, saws, lasers, and other toys reward different approaches—and finishing a level cleanly often comes down to picking one good angle and sticking to it. Progress adds new characters and layouts while keeping controls simple.","/media/blumgi-castle.webp",[72,10],"puzzle","https://23azostore.github.io/s2/blumgi-castle/",{"slug":75,"title":76,"description":77,"image":78,"categories":79,"format":11,"url":80},"blumgi-rocket","Blumgi Rocket","Blumgi Rocket is a side‑scrolling platformer built around a rocket‑boosted car. You hold for thrust, enjoy a short slow‑motion window during burns, and use stunts to keep pace through hills, tunnels, and tight gaps. Tracks hide shortcuts and safer lines, so a clean route often matters more than constant speed. New skins arrive as you clear levels, and the handling stays consistent enough that learning one car’s rhythm carries across the set.","/media/blumgi-rocket.webp",[9,10],"https://webglmath.github.io/blumgi-rocket/",{"slug":82,"title":83,"description":84,"image":85,"categories":86,"format":11,"url":87},"blumgi-slime","Blumgi Slime","Blumgi Slime is a jump‑only platformer. Your character can’t walk, so you hold to charge, release to leap, and aim for clean arcs that land on safe ground or the checkered goal. Stages add new colors and obstacle types as you go, but the core stays readable: judge distance, pick a height, and commit. It’s a simple loop that feels good when you string jumps together without hesitation.","/media/blumgi-slime.webp",[9,10],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/blumgi-slime",{"slug":89,"title":90,"description":91,"image":92,"categories":93,"format":11,"url":94},"boxing-physics-2","Boxing Physics 2","Boxing Physics 2 turns boxing into a simple, ragdoll‑driven duel that’s more about timing than complicated inputs. Matches are short races to five points. You press a single key to punch, jump and lurch all at once, and the wobble of each fighter creates odd angles where a clean hit can land. Rounds change the setup so you’re not always fighting on the same surface, and learning to wait for balance before throwing is the difference between whiffing and scoring. A good approach is to hold a little distance, watch for your opponent to lean forward or lose footing, then tap at that exact moment. If a power‑up appears, use it to extend reach or finish a round from safety. The best wins come from calm reads rather than button mashing, and once you catch the rhythm, comebacks happen fast.","/media/boxing-physics-2.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/boxing-physics-2/",{"slug":96,"title":97,"description":98,"image":99,"categories":100,"format":11,"url":101},"boxing-random","Boxing Random","Boxing Random is a one‑button boxing game built on ragdoll movement and changing conditions. Every round shifts something—the footing, outfits, even little twists to how a punch connects—so you adapt as you go and try to be first to five points. Controls stay simple; the challenge is timing. Keep your boxer balanced, wait for the opponent to tilt into range, and press when their guard drops or they overextend. If a rocket punch or special round shows up, use the extra reach but don’t chase wildly, because falling out of rhythm usually costs the point. With a friend beside you it’s easy to trade wins for a long stretch, and most matches are decided by a couple of well‑timed taps.","/media/boxing-random.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s77/boxing-random/",1765456730277]
