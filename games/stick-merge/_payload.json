Each round plays out in short bursts of movement and discussion: fix a sabotage, finish a task, or report a body and talk through what you’ve seen. Crewmates win by finishing all tasks or voting out the impostors; impostors win by causing enough chaos and eliminating the crew without being caught.\n\nIt’s easy to understand after a few matches and scales well with different group sizes. Maps change the layout of tasks and travel routes, and small settings tweaks can make games faster or more methodical. The appeal is in the stories that form—alibis that don’t add up, quiet players who turn out to be sharp observers, and those tense moments around the emergency button when suspicion swings from one person to another.","/media/among-us.webp",[10,20],"popular","https://amongusplay.online/",{"slug":23,"title":24,"description":25,"image":26,"categories":27,"format":11,"url":28},"cannon-strike","Cannon Strike","Cannon Strike is a physics puzzle about firing pellets into a container while the path changes around you. You set angle and timing from a fixed cannon, then watch pellets bounce off surfaces, slip through rotating bars, and settle—if you judged correctly—where you need them. Early levels are forgiving, but later layouts ask for tighter shots and a better sense of how motion will carry after a bounce.\n\nMoment to moment you’re deciding whether to shoot now or wait for a safer alignment. The game respects patience; a clean release is usually better than brute force. Limited ammo or stricter thresholds show up as you progress, which encourages smarter planning rather than rushing. It’s the kind of puzzle where each success feels earned, and small adjustments lead to reliable solutions without trial‑and‑error grind.","/media/cannon-strike.webp",[9],"https://gamaverse.com/c/f/g/cannon-strike/",{"slug":30,"title":31,"description":32,"image":33,"categories":34,"format":11,"url":35},"chicken-merge","Chicken Merge","Chicken Merge mixes idle merging with light defense. You place chickens on slots to shoot approaching targets, then drag identical units together to create stronger ones. Waves escalate gradually, and coins earned during play fund more slots and upgrades, which keep the board feeling busy without demanding constant micromanagement.\n\nThe moment‑to‑moment decisions are simple—merge now for immediate damage or hold pieces to combine later into a bigger tier; reposition a strong unit to cover a weak lane; invest in economy or in firepower. Progress comes in steady steps, and small optimizations turn into noticeable gains. It’s a pleasant loop that works for brief sessions and longer stretches, with clear feedback and enough variety to stay engaging.","/media/chicken-merge.webp",[10],"https://23azostore.github.io/s4/chicken-merge/",{"slug":37,"title":38,"description":39,"image":40,"categories":41,"format":11,"url":43},"free-kick-shooter","Free Kick Shooter","Free Kick Shooter tests your accuracy and precision as you take free kicks from various positions on the field.
