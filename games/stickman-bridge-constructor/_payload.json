You interact with the scene directly—drag items, combine them, move text, or reveal things hidden off screen—to find the trick that solves the level. The draw is the steady stream of small “aha” moments and the way even simple prompts hide playful solutions. If you’re stuck, read the question carefully, try manipulating the background, and consider whether the answer comes from an object you create rather than one already shown. It’s light, fast, and designed for quick sessions that feel satisfying when a stubborn level finally gives way.","/media/brain-test-tricky-puzzles.webp",[9,20,21],"popular","new","https://23azostore.github.io/s2/brain-test-tricky-puzzles/",{"slug":24,"title":25,"description":26,"image":27,"categories":28,"format":11,"url":29},"arithmetica","Arithmetica","Arithmetica is a one‑minute sprint of mental math. Equations appear quickly and you tap the correct answer; each fast, correct response adds a sliver of time, and misses waste precious seconds. It’s simple to start and ramps up as your pace increases.\n\nPlayed daily, it’s a tidy way to sharpen arithmetic in short sessions. The loop is honest—speed comes from accuracy—and the timer makes even basic problems feel engaging when you’re chasing a personal best.","/media/arithmetica.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/arithmetica/",{"slug":31,"title":32,"description":33,"image":34,"categories":35,"format":11,"url":37},"blumgi-ball","Blumgi Ball","Blumgi Ball blends basketball shots with simple puzzle layouts. You pull back to set power and angle, release to send the ball, and press to teleport next to it so you can chain throws from smarter positions. Levels introduce surfaces, gaps, and tricks that ask for one or two clean shots rather than brute force. As you clear stages, you unlock new characters and learn small habits—teleport before the bounce you want, aim lower when an obstacle steals arc, and keep attempts tight to avoid awkward ricochets. It’s compact, responsive, and satisfying when a planned sequence lands.","/media/blumgi-ball.webp",[36,10],"sports","https://sudoku-online.github.io/a2/blumgi-ball/",{"slug":39,"title":40,"description":41,"image":42,"categories":43,"format":11,"url":44},"blumgi-castle","Blumgi Castle","Blumgi Castle is a slingshot skill game about dropping enemies into the water with well‑placed shots and tools. You aim with an indicator, hold to set power, and release to fire bombs or special weapons that can carve platforms, push creatures off edges, or clear cover. There’s room to experiment—bigger blasts, saws, lasers, and other toys reward different approaches—and finishing a level cleanly often comes down to picking one good angle and sticking to it.

You hold for thrust, enjoy a short slow‑motion window during burns, and use stunts to keep pace through hills, tunnels, and tight gaps. Tracks hide shortcuts and safer lines, so a clean route often matters more than constant speed. New skins arrive as you clear levels, and the handling stays consistent enough that learning one car’s rhythm carries across the set.","/media/blumgi-rocket.webp",[51,10],"arcade","https://webglmath.github.io/blumgi-rocket/",{"slug":54,"title":55,"description":56,"image":57,"categories":58,"format":11,"url":59},"blumgi-slime","Blumgi Slime","Blumgi Slime is a jump‑only platformer. Your character can’t walk, so you hold to charge, release to leap, and aim for clean arcs that land on safe ground or the checkered goal. Stages add new colors and obstacle types as you go, but the core stays readable: judge distance, pick a height, and commit.

Obstacles rotate and shift, forcing you to hold a steady rhythm and wait for a safe opening. It’s clear and readable, and the quick restart makes it easy to turn a small mistake into another attempt without friction.\n\nMoment to moment you’re deciding whether to risk a pass early or let the pattern cycle once more. Pace picks up as layouts demand consecutive clean taps, and patience often beats rushing. The appeal is in the simplicity: one input, reliable rules, and obstacles that always teach you something about timing.

Traffic and rivers form shifting patterns: cars pace in lanes, logs glide at different speeds, and trains cut through on a strict schedule. You dart across when a window opens, pause when it closes, and learn to avoid risky moves that lead to stranded hops.\n\nMoment to moment you’re scanning a few steps ahead and trusting small timings—a quick double hop, a hold to let a lane clear, a step back to avoid a bad sequence. The pace is gentle at first and grows as you survive longer, and the satisfaction comes from making clean, sensible choices.

The rhythm is brisk—quick restarts, visible improvement—and scores rise when you stop chasing miracles and string together clean decisions.
