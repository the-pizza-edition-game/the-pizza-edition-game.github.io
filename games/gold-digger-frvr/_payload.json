One moment you’re angling a toe‑poke past a frantic goalkeeper, the next you’re timing a leap in an archery duel or baiting a rival tank onto a cliff. The physics are playful but consistent, so the difference between chaos and control is learning the rhythm and trusting your timing.\n\nWhat makes it sticky is the speed. Rounds last seconds, momentum swings fast, and that single well‑timed press can feel like a masterstroke when the crowd erupts. You don’t need to memorize systems or grind unlocks; the fun comes from reading each scenario and improvising under pressure. It’s the kind of game that turns a quiet evening into a tournament where \"best of five\" becomes \"best of twenty\" without anyone noticing—easy to start, hard to stop, and perfectly tuned for laughter, grudge matches, and tiny comebacks that feel huge.","/media/12-minibattles.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/12-minibattles/",{"slug":30,"title":31,"description":32,"image":33,"categories":34,"format":10,"url":35},"a-dance-of-fire-and-ice","A Dance of Fire and Ice","A Dance of Fire and Ice is rhythm distilled: one button, perfect timing, and paths that turn music into motion. Two luminous orbs trace angles, gaps, and sudden switches, and your only job is to press exactly on the beat. There’s no generous buffer or off‑beat mercy—calibrate once, breathe, and trust the soundtrack as patterns grow from simple steps to layered syncopation.\n\nEach world introduces an idea and then tests your understanding with playful twists. A time signature change resets your count, a deceptive curve hides a double tap, a quiet bridge asks for focus more than speed. It’s challenging but fair, and when the press lands and the path flows without a stutter, there’s a singular satisfaction in the way sound and motion snap into one. For rhythm‑game devotees, it’s pure signal: clear rules, precise feedback, and the enduring thrill of mastery.","/media/a-dance-of-fire-and-ice.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s8/a-dance-of-fire-and-ice/",{"slug":37,"title":38,"description":39,"image":40,"categories":41,"format":10,"url":42},"aqua-thrills","Aqua Thrills","Aqua Thrills is a fast water‑slide racer about simple steering and good timing. You guide a tube down long, winding slides, adjust left and right to hold a line, and bump rivals when you need space. Races are short and forgiving at first, then add tighter curves, faster sections, and hazards that ask for cleaner inputs.\n\nProgress brings new parks, slides, and cosmetic unlocks. The controls stay straightforward, which makes it easy to jump in for a few runs and see improvement quickly. If you enjoy lightweight racing with clear feedback and quick restarts, it scratches that itch well without getting complicated.","/media/aqua-thrills.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/aqua-thrills/",{"slug":44,"title":45,"description":46,"image":47,"categories":48,"format":10,"url":49},"battle-wheels","Battle Wheels","Battle Wheels is a quick 1v1 arena bout where open‑top cars try to bonk each other on the head. You lurch forward and back to build rhythm, flip for height, and aim to land a clean hit that drains health. Between rounds, simple upgrades to health, damage, and wheels help your car feel sturdier or sharper, and a local two‑player mode turns it into a light, competitive party game. The physics do most of the work—small nudges set up flips, and flips set up roof drops—so the match becomes about timing rather than perfect driving lines. It’s fast, readable, and good for a few rounds at a time.","/media/battle-wheels.webp",[9],"https://i.gamesgo.net/uploads/game/html5/25939/",{"slug":51,"title":52,"description":53,"image":54,"categories":55,"format":10,"url":56},"big-shot-boxing","Big Shot Boxing","Big Shot Boxing is a pared‑down boxing career that hinges on patient timing. Fights use a small set of inputs—jabs, crosses, uppercuts, and blocks—and the rhythm is about stamina, guard openings, and taking the simple shot when it’s there. Outside the ring you pick a trainer, build basic stats, and climb from early cards toward title bouts, with the sense that any match can swing if you lose focus. The pixel look fits the straightforward design, and the loop of train‑fight‑recover makes short sessions feel productive. If you like boxing without complex systems, this offers honest rounds where a few good reads decide the night.","/media/big-shot-boxing.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/big-shot-boxing/",{"slug":58,"title":59,"description":60,"image":61,"categories":62,"format":10,"url":64},"blumgi-rocket","Blumgi Rocket","Blumgi Rocket is a side‑scrolling platformer built around a rocket‑boosted car. You hold for thrust, enjoy a short slow‑motion window during burns, and use stunts to keep pace through hills, tunnels, and tight gaps. Tracks hide shortcuts and safer lines, so a clean route often matters more than constant speed. New skins arrive as you clear levels, and the handling stays consistent enough that learning one car’s rhythm carries across the set.","/media/blumgi-rocket.webp",[9,63],"originals","https://webglmath.github.io/blumgi-rocket/",{"slug":66,"title":67,"description":68,"image":69,"categories":70,"format":10,"url":71},"blumgi-slime","Blumgi Slime","Blumgi Slime is a jump‑only platformer. Your character can’t walk, so you hold to charge, release to leap, and aim for clean arcs that land on safe ground or the checkered goal. Stages add new colors and obstacle types as you go, but the core stays readable: judge distance, pick a height, and commit. It’s a simple loop that feels good when you string jumps together without hesitation.","/media/blumgi-slime.webp",[9,63],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/blumgi-slime",{"slug":73,"title":74,"description":75,"image":76,"categories":77,"format":10,"url":78},"boxing-physics-2","Boxing Physics 2","Boxing Physics 2 turns boxing into a simple, ragdoll‑driven duel that’s more about timing than complicated inputs. Matches are short races to five points. You press a single key to punch, jump and lurch all at once, and the wobble of each fighter creates odd angles where a clean hit can land. Rounds change the setup so you’re not always fighting on the same surface, and learning to wait for balance before throwing is the difference between whiffing and scoring. A good approach is to hold a little distance, watch for your opponent to lean forward or lose footing, then tap at that exact moment. If a power‑up appears, use it to extend reach or finish a round from safety. The best wins come from calm reads rather than button mashing, and once you catch the rhythm, comebacks happen fast.","/media/boxing-physics-2.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/boxing-physics-2/",{"slug":80,"title":81,"description":82,"image":83,"categories":84,"format":10,"url":85},"boxing-random","Boxing Random","Boxing Random is a one‑button boxing game built on ragdoll movement and changing conditions. Every round shifts something—the footing, outfits, even little twists to how a punch connects—so you adapt as you go and try to be first to five points. Controls stay simple; the challenge is timing. Keep your boxer balanced, wait for the opponent to tilt into range, and press when their guard drops or they overextend. If a rocket punch or special round shows up, use the extra reach but don’t chase wildly, because falling out of rhythm usually costs the point. With a friend beside you it’s easy to trade wins for a long stretch, and most matches are decided by a couple of well‑timed taps.","/media/boxing-random.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s77/boxing-random/",{"slug":87,"title":88,"description":89,"image":90,"categories":91,"format":10,"url":92},"bubble-trouble","Bubble Trouble","Bubble Trouble is a remake of the classic bubble‑splitting arcade formula. You stand under bouncing spheres and fire a harpoon straight up; each pop splits a bubble into smaller ones until they’re tiny enough to destroy. The game is about discipline more than speed: clear space, watch bounce paths, and don’t get greedy when a cluster looks tempting. A safe rhythm is to thin big bubbles first to reduce random bounces, then finish the small ones while you have headroom. Two‑player mode adds friendly chaos, but the core stays the same—steady positioning and controlled shots.","/media/bubble-trouble.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/bubble-trouble/",{"slug":94,"title":95,"description":96,"image":97,"categories":98,"format":10,"url":99},"bubble-trouble-3","Bubble Trouble 3","Bubble Trouble 3 continues the split‑and‑clear loop with more stages and a two‑player option. You use a vertical shot to divide large bubbles, then reduce the field step by step until every last one is gone. The trick is reading bounce angles and leaving yourself an exit when patterns tighten—pop a bubble in a corner, move out, then clean up rather than standing under a dense cluster. It’s simple to learn and still tense when a single stray bounce can end a round.","/media/bubble-trouble-3.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/bubble-trouble-3/",1765456731357]
