Tap to hook onto points and release to fly through the air.\n\nThe game features hundreds of levels with increasing difficulty. Use momentum and physics to navigate obstacles, bounce off pads, and cross the finish line. Can you master the swing and become the ultimate stickman hooker?","/media/stickman-hook.webp",[9,10,11],"arcade","popular","originals","html5","https://webglmath.github.io/stickmanhook/",[15,24,31,39,46,54,61,69,76,83,90,97],{"slug":16,"title":17,"description":18,"image":19,"categories":20,"format":12,"url":23},"drive-mad","Drive Mad","Drive Mad is a compact physics‑based drive across uneven tracks where keeping the vehicle upright is the whole game. Bridges wobble, platforms tilt, and small jumps punish heavy landings. You feather the throttle, tap the brake to settle, and accept that patience solves more problems than speed.\n\nMoment to moment you’re managing weight: lean in before a ramp, lift to avoid a nose‑down crash, and correct mid‑air without oversteering. Levels escalate cleanly, and the best clears feel like tidy puzzles solved by good pacing. It’s playful, readable, and built for quick wins that stack up.","/media/drive-mad.webp",[21,10,22],"driving","new","https://drive-madgame.github.io/file/",{"slug":25,"title":26,"description":27,"image":28,"categories":29,"format":12,"url":30},"geometry-dash","Geometry Dash","Geometry Dash is a rhythm-based platformer that will test your patience and skills.

You interact with the scene directly—drag items, combine them, move text, or reveal things hidden off screen—to find the trick that solves the level. The draw is the steady stream of small “aha” moments and the way even simple prompts hide playful solutions. If you’re stuck, read the question carefully, try manipulating the background, and consider whether the answer comes from an object you create rather than one already shown. It’s light, fast, and designed for quick sessions that feel satisfying when a stubborn level finally gives way.","/media/brain-test-tricky-puzzles.webp",[37,10,22],"puzzle","https://23azostore.github.io/s2/brain-test-tricky-puzzles/",{"slug":40,"title":41,"description":42,"image":43,"categories":44,"format":12,"url":45},"12-minibattles","12 MiniBattles","12 MiniBattles captures the joy of couch competition in its purest form: two players, one button each, and a carousel of bite‑size challenges that flip the rules every round. One moment you’re angling a toe‑poke past a frantic goalkeeper, the next you’re timing a leap in an archery duel or baiting a rival tank onto a cliff. The physics are playful but consistent, so the difference between chaos and control is learning the rhythm and trusting your timing.\n\nWhat makes it sticky is the speed. Rounds last seconds, momentum swings fast, and that single well‑timed press can feel like a masterstroke when the crowd erupts. You don’t need to memorize systems or grind unlocks; the fun comes from reading each scenario and improvising under pressure. It’s the kind of game that turns a quiet evening into a tournament where \"best of five\" becomes \"best of twenty\" without anyone noticing—easy to start, hard to stop, and perfectly tuned for laughter, grudge matches, and tiny comebacks that feel huge.","/media/12-minibattles.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/12-minibattles/",{"slug":47,"title":48,"description":49,"image":50,"categories":51,"format":12,"url":53},"8-ball-pool","8 Ball Pool","8 Ball Pool turns a familiar barroom duel into a sleek ladder of quick matches and steady progression. Breaks matter—set the rack moving cleanly and you’ll find patterns faster. From there it’s a lesson in touch: soft shots that nurse position, draw that opens angles on the next ball, and the quiet confidence to take a long cut when the table calls for it. Physics are crisp, so a good stroke feels honest, and mistakes teach immediately.\n\nAs your aim improves, the rooms change, stakes rise, and tournaments test whether you can string frames under pressure. Coins unlock cues and venues, but the heart stays in the geometry—finding routes that keep you in control and refusing the hero shot when the safety is wiser. Matches are short enough to fit a break and deep enough to be satisfying, and momentum can flip on a single great pot. It’s pool for the modern moment—accessible in seconds, endlessly replayable, and always nudging you toward cleaner lines.","/media/8-ball-pool.webp",[52,10],"sports","https://sudoku-online.github.io/a8/8-ball-pool/",{"slug":55,"title":56,"description":57,"image":58,"categories":59,"format":12,"url":60},"a-dance-of-fire-and-ice","A Dance of Fire and Ice","A Dance of Fire and Ice is rhythm distilled: one button, perfect timing, and paths that turn music into motion. Two luminous orbs trace angles, gaps, and sudden switches, and your only job is to press exactly on the beat. There’s no generous buffer or off‑beat mercy—calibrate once, breathe, and trust the soundtrack as patterns grow from simple steps to layered syncopation.\n\nEach world introduces an idea and then tests your understanding with playful twists. A time signature change resets your count, a deceptive curve hides a double tap, a quiet bridge asks for focus more than speed. It’s challenging but fair, and when the press lands and the path flows without a stutter, there’s a singular satisfaction in the way sound and motion snap into one. For rhythm‑game devotees, it’s pure signal: clear rules, precise feedback, and the enduring thrill of mastery.","/media/a-dance-of-fire-and-ice.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s8/a-dance-of-fire-and-ice/",{"slug":62,"title":63,"description":64,"image":65,"categories":66,"format":12,"url":68},"among-us","Among Us","Among Us is a social deduction game where a team of crewmates tries to complete simple tasks while one or more impostors work to stop them. Each round plays out in short bursts of movement and discussion: fix a sabotage, finish a task, or report a body and talk through what you’ve seen. Crewmates win by finishing all tasks or voting out the impostors; impostors win by causing enough chaos and eliminating the crew without being caught.\n\nIt’s easy to understand after a few matches and scales well with different group sizes. Maps change the layout of tasks and travel routes, and small settings tweaks can make games faster or more methodical. The appeal is in the stories that form—alibis that don’t add up, quiet players who turn out to be sharp observers, and those tense moments around the emergency button when suspicion swings from one person to another.","/media/among-us.webp",[67,10],"strategy","https://amongusplay.online/",{"slug":70,"title":71,"description":72,"image":73,"categories":74,"format":12,"url":75},"aqua-thrills","Aqua Thrills","Aqua Thrills is a fast water‑slide racer about simple steering and good timing. You guide a tube down long, winding slides, adjust left and right to hold a line, and bump rivals when you need space. Races are short and forgiving at first, then add tighter curves, faster sections, and hazards that ask for cleaner inputs.\n\nProgress brings new parks, slides, and cosmetic unlocks. The controls stay straightforward, which makes it easy to jump in for a few runs and see improvement quickly. If you enjoy lightweight racing with clear feedback and quick restarts, it scratches that itch well without getting complicated.","/media/aqua-thrills.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/aqua-thrills/",{"slug":77,"title":78,"description":79,"image":80,"categories":81,"format":12,"url":82},"basketball-stars","Basketball Stars","Basketball Stars is a fast one‑minute basketball match with simple controls and clear momentum swings. You pick a character, choose a mode, and trade drives, blocks, steals, and jump shots in tight possessions that reward timing more than complex inputs. Modes cover quick games, bracket tournaments, and local two‑player play in 1v1 or 2v2, so it works well for a short break or a longer run. Most of the depth comes from small reads—hold position for a block instead of chasing, dash into space for a clean dunk, or save a special move for the last possession. It’s easy to pick up, lively when played with a friend, and competitive enough to keep rematches coming.","/media/basketball-stars.webp",[52,10],"https://basketballstarsonline.github.io/file/",{"slug":84,"title":85,"description":86,"image":87,"categories":88,"format":12,"url":89},"battle-wheels","Battle Wheels","Battle Wheels is a quick 1v1 arena bout where open‑top cars try to bonk each other on the head. You lurch forward and back to build rhythm, flip for height, and aim to land a clean hit that drains health. Between rounds, simple upgrades to health, damage, and wheels help your car feel sturdier or sharper, and a local two‑player mode turns it into a light, competitive party game. The physics do most of the work—small nudges set up flips, and flips set up roof drops—so the match becomes about timing rather than perfect driving lines. It’s fast, readable, and good for a few rounds at a time.","/media/battle-wheels.webp",[9],"https://i.gamesgo.net/uploads/game/html5/25939/",{"slug":91,"title":92,"description":93,"image":94,"categories":95,"format":12,"url":96},"big-shot-boxing","Big Shot Boxing","Big Shot Boxing is a pared‑down boxing career that hinges on patient timing. Fights use a small set of inputs—jabs, crosses, uppercuts, and blocks—and the rhythm is about stamina, guard openings, and taking the simple shot when it’s there. Outside the ring you pick a trainer, build basic stats, and climb from early cards toward title bouts, with the sense that any match can swing if you lose focus. The pixel look fits the straightforward design, and the loop of train‑fight‑recover makes short sessions feel productive. If you like boxing without complex systems, this offers honest rounds where a few good reads decide the night.","/media/big-shot-boxing.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/big-shot-boxing/",{"slug":98,"title":99,"description":100,"image":101,"categories":102,"format":12,"url":103},"blumgi-ball","Blumgi Ball","Blumgi Ball blends basketball shots with simple puzzle layouts. You pull back to set power and angle, release to send the ball, and press to teleport next to it so you can chain throws from smarter positions. Levels introduce surfaces, gaps, and tricks that ask for one or two clean shots rather than brute force. As you clear stages, you unlock new characters and learn small habits—teleport before the bounce you want, aim lower when an obstacle steals arc, and keep attempts tight to avoid awkward ricochets. It’s compact, responsive, and satisfying when a planned sequence lands.","/media/blumgi-ball.webp",[52,11],"https://sudoku-online.github.io/a2/blumgi-ball/",1765456729850]
