The episodes were eventually produced by the show's Mexico-based animation house, Val-Mar Studios.\n\nAlready nervous about the story's violent content, after the horrific events of November 22, 1963, both NBC and sponsor General Mills were so mortified by the coincidental similarities of the plot of the episodes and the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas Texas, they ordered the story pulled from broadcast before it aired. All prints were believed destroyed. Ward asked Stone for his money back.\n\nThe extravagant cost of the whole debacle (nearly twenty dollars) ultimately led to the cancellation of \"The Bullwinkle Show.\"\n\nIn 2008 the films were rediscovered in the evidence files of the Warren Commission in the National Archives. Originally mislabeled \"Kennedy Stag Films,\" the lost cartoons had been overlooked for decades by researchers.\n\nThe four battered film canisters were found between the back of a file cabinet and the wall of a neglected storage room. The footage was badly damaged and deteriorated, and the soundtrack distorted, but the historical significance is undeniable...\n\nThese treasures of animation have now been de-classified and RESTORED so that they can be enjoyed by a new generation!\n\nThis film is a not-for-profit fan-made project and is intended as a parody.

You set angle and timing from a fixed cannon, then watch pellets bounce off surfaces, slip through rotating bars, and settle—if you judged correctly—where you need them. Early levels are forgiving, but later layouts ask for tighter shots and a better sense of how motion will carry after a bounce.\n\nMoment to moment you’re deciding whether to shoot now or wait for a safer alignment. The game respects patience; a clean release is usually better than brute force. Limited ammo or stricter thresholds show up as you progress, which encourages smarter planning rather than rushing. It’s the kind of puzzle where each success feels earned, and small adjustments lead to reliable solutions without trial‑and‑error grind.","/media/cannon-strike.webp",[9],"html5","https://gamaverse.com/c/f/g/cannon-strike/",{"slug":22,"title":23,"description":24,"image":25,"categories":26,"format":19,"url":28},"free-kick-shooter","Free Kick Shooter","Free Kick Shooter tests your accuracy and precision as you take free kicks from various positions on the field.
