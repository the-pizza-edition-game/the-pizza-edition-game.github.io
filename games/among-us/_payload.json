Each round plays out in short bursts of movement and discussion: fix a sabotage, finish a task, or report a body and talk through what you’ve seen. Crewmates win by finishing all tasks or voting out the impostors; impostors win by causing enough chaos and eliminating the crew without being caught.\n\nIt’s easy to understand after a few matches and scales well with different group sizes. Maps change the layout of tasks and travel routes, and small settings tweaks can make games faster or more methodical. The appeal is in the stories that form—alibis that don’t add up, quiet players who turn out to be sharp observers, and those tense moments around the emergency button when suspicion swings from one person to another.","/media/among-us.webp",[9,10],"strategy","popular","html5","https://amongusplay.online/",[14,23,31,39,47,54,61,68,75,82,89,96],{"slug":15,"title":16,"description":17,"image":18,"categories":19,"format":11,"url":22},"drive-mad","Drive Mad","Drive Mad is a compact physics‑based drive across uneven tracks where keeping the vehicle upright is the whole game. Bridges wobble, platforms tilt, and small jumps punish heavy landings. You feather the throttle, tap the brake to settle, and accept that patience solves more problems than speed.\n\nMoment to moment you’re managing weight: lean in before a ramp, lift to avoid a nose‑down crash, and correct mid‑air without oversteering. Levels escalate cleanly, and the best clears feel like tidy puzzles solved by good pacing. It’s playful, readable, and built for quick wins that stack up.","/media/drive-mad.webp",[20,10,21],"driving","new","https://drive-madgame.github.io/file/",{"slug":24,"title":25,"description":26,"image":27,"categories":28,"format":11,"url":30},"geometry-dash","Geometry Dash","Geometry Dash is a rhythm-based platformer that will test your patience and skills.

You interact with the scene directly—drag items, combine them, move text, or reveal things hidden off screen—to find the trick that solves the level. The draw is the steady stream of small “aha” moments and the way even simple prompts hide playful solutions. If you’re stuck, read the question carefully, try manipulating the background, and consider whether the answer comes from an object you create rather than one already shown. It’s light, fast, and designed for quick sessions that feel satisfying when a stubborn level finally gives way.","/media/brain-test-tricky-puzzles.webp",[37,10,21],"puzzle","https://23azostore.github.io/s2/brain-test-tricky-puzzles/",{"slug":40,"title":41,"description":42,"image":43,"categories":44,"format":11,"url":46},"8-ball-pool","8 Ball Pool","8 Ball Pool turns a familiar barroom duel into a sleek ladder of quick matches and steady progression. Breaks matter—set the rack moving cleanly and you’ll find patterns faster. From there it’s a lesson in touch: soft shots that nurse position, draw that opens angles on the next ball, and the quiet confidence to take a long cut when the table calls for it. Physics are crisp, so a good stroke feels honest, and mistakes teach immediately.\n\nAs your aim improves, the rooms change, stakes rise, and tournaments test whether you can string frames under pressure. Coins unlock cues and venues, but the heart stays in the geometry—finding routes that keep you in control and refusing the hero shot when the safety is wiser. Matches are short enough to fit a break and deep enough to be satisfying, and momentum can flip on a single great pot. It’s pool for the modern moment—accessible in seconds, endlessly replayable, and always nudging you toward cleaner lines.","/media/8-ball-pool.webp",[45,10],"sports","https://sudoku-online.github.io/a8/8-ball-pool/",{"slug":48,"title":49,"description":50,"image":51,"categories":52,"format":11,"url":53},"basketball-stars","Basketball Stars","Basketball Stars is a fast one‑minute basketball match with simple controls and clear momentum swings. You pick a character, choose a mode, and trade drives, blocks, steals, and jump shots in tight possessions that reward timing more than complex inputs. Modes cover quick games, bracket tournaments, and local two‑player play in 1v1 or 2v2, so it works well for a short break or a longer run. Most of the depth comes from small reads—hold position for a block instead of chasing, dash into space for a clean dunk, or save a special move for the last possession. It’s easy to pick up, lively when played with a friend, and competitive enough to keep rematches coming.","/media/basketball-stars.webp",[45,10],"https://basketballstarsonline.github.io/file/",{"slug":55,"title":56,"description":57,"image":58,"categories":59,"format":11,"url":60},"chicken-merge","Chicken Merge","Chicken Merge mixes idle merging with light defense. You place chickens on slots to shoot approaching targets, then drag identical units together to create stronger ones. Waves escalate gradually, and coins earned during play fund more slots and upgrades, which keep the board feeling busy without demanding constant micromanagement.\n\nThe moment‑to‑moment decisions are simple—merge now for immediate damage or hold pieces to combine later into a bigger tier; reposition a strong unit to cover a weak lane; invest in economy or in firepower. Progress comes in steady steps, and small optimizations turn into noticeable gains. It’s a pleasant loop that works for brief sessions and longer stretches, with clear feedback and enough variety to stay engaging.","/media/chicken-merge.webp",[9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s4/chicken-merge/",{"slug":62,"title":63,"description":64,"image":65,"categories":66,"format":11,"url":67},"cookie-clicker","Cookie Clicker","Cookie Clicker is an incremental game about turning simple clicks into ever‑larger numbers. You start by making cookies manually, then buy upgrades and buildings that produce them automatically. Over time the rate climbs, new options unlock, and strategic choices—what to buy next, when to save, how to balance short‑term gains with long‑term multipliers—shape your progress.\n\nThe moment to moment play alternates between active bursts and quieter planning. It’s easy to slip into a rhythm of setting goals, reaching them, and choosing the next target. The humor is dry and the systems transparent, which helps the numbers feel satisfying rather than abstract. If you enjoy watching a plan compound into bigger results, this serves that loop well without demanding constant attention.","/media/cookie-clicker.webp",[29,10],"https://23azostore.github.io/s/cookie-clicker/",{"slug":69,"title":70,"description":71,"image":72,"categories":73,"format":11,"url":74},"drift-hunters","Drift Hunters","Drift Hunters is a 3D driving game centered on controlled slides rather than racing lines. Long corners invite you to set a drift early, balance throttle and counter‑steer, and hold angle without spinning. Points accrue when you keep slides stable and string them together, so the best runs look smooth rather than wild.\n\nMoment to moment you’re reading grip and correcting gently—add gas to sustain, ease off when angle grows, and straighten cleanly before a new section. Progression gives you room to try quicker setups and refine handling, and practice turns consistent laps into flowing sessions. It’s a satisfying space to chase better control.","/media/drift-hunters.webp",[20,10],"https://www.gamenora.com/upload/games/html5/Drift%20Hunters/",{"slug":76,"title":77,"description":78,"image":79,"categories":80,"format":11,"url":81},"football-legends","Football Legends","Football Legends lets you play as famous soccer stars in intense 1-on-1 or 2-on-2 matches.
