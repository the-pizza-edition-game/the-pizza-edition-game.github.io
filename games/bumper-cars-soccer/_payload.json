You nudge, bump, and angle the car to push a giant ball toward the goal, and quick momentum changes make simple plays—cutting inside, shielding with the bumper, timing a tap at the near post—feel rewarding. Holding position matters: wait for the ball to roll across your front, then accelerate through it rather than chasing from behind. With two players, agree who defends and who presses to avoid both cars crowding the same lane.","/media/bumper-cars-soccer.webp",[9,10],"driving","sports","html5","https://23azostore.github.io/s2/bumper-cars-soccer/",[14,23,31,38,45,52,59,66,73,80,87,94],{"slug":15,"title":16,"description":17,"image":18,"categories":19,"format":11,"url":22},"drive-mad","Drive Mad","Drive Mad is a compact physics‑based drive across uneven tracks where keeping the vehicle upright is the whole game. Bridges wobble, platforms tilt, and small jumps punish heavy landings. You feather the throttle, tap the brake to settle, and accept that patience solves more problems than speed.\n\nMoment to moment you’re managing weight: lean in before a ramp, lift to avoid a nose‑down crash, and correct mid‑air without oversteering. Levels escalate cleanly, and the best clears feel like tidy puzzles solved by good pacing. It’s playful, readable, and built for quick wins that stack up.","/media/drive-mad.webp",[9,20,21],"popular","new","https://drive-madgame.github.io/file/",{"slug":24,"title":25,"description":26,"image":27,"categories":28,"format":11,"url":30},"3d-car-simulator","3d Car Simulator","3D Car Simulator is a relaxed driving playground built around feel. Three open maps—city streets, desert stretches, and quieter outskirts—give you room to experiment with a rally car’s eager turn‑in, the weighty authority of a police cruiser, or the charm of an older machine that wants a gentler hand. Without checkpoints or lap times pushing you along, it becomes about learning the language of each car: when to breathe off the throttle, how much steering the surface will accept, and the little taps of brakes that settle a chassis before a fast corner.\n\nIts strength is in the immediacy. Swap vehicles on a whim, change the camera to reframe the road, and try another line the moment an idea strikes. Drifts begin as happy accidents and become repeatable when you catch the balance point; straightaways invite the siren and a sprint; alleyways test precision as much as pace. It’s a simple, inviting stage that turns a spare five minutes into a satisfying session and rewards curiosity with those quiet \"I’ve got it\" moments that every driver chases.","/media/3d-car-simulator.webp",[29,9],"adventure","https://23azostore.github.io/s2/3d-car-simulator/",{"slug":32,"title":33,"description":34,"image":35,"categories":36,"format":11,"url":37},"3d-moto-simulator-2","3D Moto Simulator 2","3D Moto Simulator 2 is a free‑roam bike sandbox that respects the pleasure of riding for its own sake. Three bikes—nimble trials, dirt‑ready cross, and a siren‑lit police motorcycle—each bring their own character, and the maps match them with space to breathe: desert edges for open throttle, city grids for flowing corners, and off‑road pockets for playful detours. The controls are clear and responsive, so you can lean smoothly into arcs, tap the handbrake for a tight rotation, and fire a burst of nitro when a straight line begs you to.\n\nThere’s no pressure to chase a leaderboard. Instead, the game invites small goals: chain a sequence of turns without lifting, hop a median cleanly, climb a ridge and watch the skyline fall behind. Over time, those little challenges add up to muscle memory, and the ride starts to feel like a conversation between bike and road. It’s an easy game to slip into and a hard one to leave, perfect for quick sessions that somehow stretch into longer rides.","/media/3d-moto-simulator-2.webp",[29,9],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/3d-moto-simulator-2/",{"slug":39,"title":40,"description":41,"image":42,"categories":43,"format":11,"url":44},"4th-and-goal-2022","4th and Goal 2022","4th and Goal 2022 distills American football into brisk drives and meaningful decisions. The playbook is compact but expressive: inside runs to set a rhythm, option looks that punish over‑pursuit, and timing routes that reward a calm read when a safety bites. On defense, a well‑chosen blitz can flip a possession, while disciplined coverage squeezes windows until a hurried throw invites a takeaway.\n\nModes range from quick games to deeper playoff runs, and the tone stays consistent—intuitive controls, short possessions, and enough tactical space that smart play‑calling tells. Drives hinge on small choices: take the yards and bleed the clock, or push for a dagger before the half; pin them deep with field position, or gamble on fourth down when momentum is yours. Red‑zone snaps carry that familiar knot in the stomach, and touchdowns feel earned rather than scripted. It’s football trimmed to essentials, lively and readable, where a season’s story is written in a handful of clutch plays.","/media/4th-and-goal-2022.webp",[10,21],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/4th-and-goal-2022/",{"slug":46,"title":47,"description":48,"image":49,"categories":50,"format":11,"url":51},"4x4-drive-offroad","4x4 Drive Offroad","4x4 Drive Offroad is a slow‑burn celebration of traction and patience. Heavy SUVs and trucks invite you to pick lines carefully—nose up to a ledge, let the tires find a bite, and ease the throttle until weight shifts just enough to carry over. Long climbs reward composure more than power, and muddy patches punish an overeager foot with spin where a feathered touch would glide.\n\nIt’s a game of scouting and adjusting. Change the camera to make sense of a ridge, back off and angle for a safer approach, or commit when you feel the chassis settle and know the truck will hold. Repairs keep the loop generous, so experimentation never stalls, and with each crest, confidence grows. The result is a calm, methodical kind of driving where success feels earned—those quiet moments when the wheels bite, the slope gives way, and the hillside you doubted becomes another story you’re proud to tell.","/media/4x4-drive-offroad.webp",[9],"https://gswitch3.github.io/g7/4x4-drive-offroad/",{"slug":53,"title":54,"description":55,"image":56,"categories":57,"format":11,"url":58},"8-ball-pool","8 Ball Pool","8 Ball Pool turns a familiar barroom duel into a sleek ladder of quick matches and steady progression. Breaks matter—set the rack moving cleanly and you’ll find patterns faster. From there it’s a lesson in touch: soft shots that nurse position, draw that opens angles on the next ball, and the quiet confidence to take a long cut when the table calls for it. Physics are crisp, so a good stroke feels honest, and mistakes teach immediately.\n\nAs your aim improves, the rooms change, stakes rise, and tournaments test whether you can string frames under pressure. Coins unlock cues and venues, but the heart stays in the geometry—finding routes that keep you in control and refusing the hero shot when the safety is wiser. Matches are short enough to fit a break and deep enough to be satisfying, and momentum can flip on a single great pot. It’s pool for the modern moment—accessible in seconds, endlessly replayable, and always nudging you toward cleaner lines.","/media/8-ball-pool.webp",[10,20],"https://sudoku-online.github.io/a8/8-ball-pool/",{"slug":60,"title":61,"description":62,"image":63,"categories":64,"format":11,"url":65},"a-small-world-cup","A Small World Cup","A Small World Cup is soccer reimagined as a ragdoll duel, equal parts slapstick and strategy. You drag to aim a full‑body lunge, release, and your solitary player rockets across the pitch—sometimes threading a perfect shot, sometimes pinwheeling into the post to howls of laughter. The controls are simple, but the timing isn’t; angles off the boards, recovery windows, and feints that bait an over‑commit all matter when a match tightens.\n\nModes capture the tournament mood in miniature, from sudden‑death thrillers to full brackets that fit neatly into a short session. Beneath the chaos is a core of honest competition: the better read wins more often, and a last‑second volley can swing a game from despair to delight. It’s quick, silly, and unexpectedly deep—the kind of game that fills a room with noise, then goes quiet for a heartbeat as the ball arcs toward the net.","/media/a-small-world-cup.webp",[10],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/a-small-world-cup/",{"slug":67,"title":68,"description":69,"image":70,"categories":71,"format":11,"url":72},"adventure-drivers","Adventure Drivers","Adventure Drivers turns a string of island tracks into an arcade‑leaning chase for first place. You begin in a sturdy van and earn your way into faster machines as jumps grow wilder and shortcuts more tempting. Ramps, collapsing bridges, and explosive surprises layer the lanes, so races become a conversation between risk and reward: save a boost for the final climb, commit to an outer ledge for a bold pass, or time a flip to squeeze extra momentum when every second counts.\n\nVehicles feel tough, encouraging fearless landings and aggressive lines, while upgrades nudge you toward a build that matches your style—top speed for clear air, handling for tricky segments, armor when the course fights back. It’s bright, punchy, and satisfying, the kind of racing where each heat tells a small story of guts and timing, and a perfect jump can turn a middling lap into a win.","/media/adventure-drivers.webp",[9],"https://gswitch3.github.io/g7/adventure-drivers/",{"slug":74,"title":75,"description":76,"image":77,"categories":78,"format":11,"url":79},"air-hockey-championship-deluxe","Air Hockey Championship Deluxe","Air Hockey Championship Deluxe trims multiplayer competition down to reflex and geometry. First to seven takes the game, and every face‑off is a lesson in reading rebounds—bank a shot off the boards to open a lane, bait a gap with a soft touch, then meet the return with a clean block that turns defense into attack. Solo play offers steady practice; across the table, two‑player duels swing on a single perfect slap.\n\nUnlockable pucks and tables add personality without getting in the way of what matters: responsive control, brisk points, and that satisfying thunk when a shot rockets home. It’s easy to pick up and hard to truly dominate, the kind of match that starts as a quick break and ends five games later because neither side can bear to leave the last one undecided.","/media/air-hockey-championship-deluxe.webp",[10],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/air-hockey-championship-deluxe/",{"slug":81,"title":82,"description":83,"image":84,"categories":85,"format":11,"url":86},"archery-world-tour","Archery World Tour","Archery World Tour focuses on clean, readable shots and small adjustments that matter. You aim at targets across different ranges and account for wind that can push an arrow off line. Later stages add moving and rotating targets or partial cover, so you learn to set power and angle with a bit more care.\n\nOutside the main tour, a balloon challenge mode offers quick practice runs that emphasize judging drift and release timing. The format is straightforward, the feedback is clear, and landing a centered shot is consistently satisfying.","/media/archery-world-tour.webp",[10],"https://23azostore.github.io/s/archery-world-tour/",{"slug":88,"title":89,"description":90,"image":91,"categories":92,"format":11,"url":93},"athletics-hero","Athletics Hero","Athletics Hero offers a compact set of track‑and‑field events built around timing. The 100m asks for rhythmic inputs to keep speed, javelin rewards a clean release at the right angle, and triple jump leans on measured steps and a controlled final push. Each event explains its prompts clearly and gives immediate feedback when you mistime an action or overpower a throw.\n\nSessions are short, so it’s easy to chase medals and try again. As you improve, the difference between silver and gold usually comes down to one good start or a better release window, which keeps retries focused and satisfying.","/media/athletics-hero.webp",[10],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/athletics-hero/",{"slug":95,"title":96,"description":97,"image":98,"categories":99,"format":11,"url":100},"basket-and-ball","Basket and Ball","Basket and Ball is a physics puzzle where you play as the ball. Levels mix trampolines, switches, and hazards like spikes and fire traps, and the goal is always the same—reach the hoop cleanly. You bounce, roll, and use the environment to build height or change direction, sometimes timing an explosion or hardening into stone to cross a tricky section.\n\nIt starts simple and gets more involved as new pieces appear. Stars encourage clean routes, but the core is generous enough for quick progress, and the controls make each retry fast. If you enjoy puzzle‑platformers with consistent rules and clear goals, it’s easy to recommend.","/media/basket-and-ball.webp",[10],"https://23azostore.github.io/s2/basket-and-ball/",1765458184430]
